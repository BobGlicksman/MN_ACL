These CAM files are known to work with JLCPCB
(https://jlcpcb.com/), a low cost Chinese PCB manufacturer.
Upload the .zip file (as is) to the JLCPCB site and use the default
PCB settings on the site.  We have found the resulting boards to work
and to be of high quality.  The price for small quantities of boards
is very low and they offer fast turnaround and low cost shipping
via DHL International.  

The CAM files will likely work with other manufacturers as well, but
he have not tried them.  We obtained high quality PCBs from OSHPark
by uploading the Eagle .brd file to their site.  The board design
is public on the OSGPark site and you can order from there, but the
price is higher than from JLCPCB.

Repository Overview

In this repo you will find all the software, hardware design files, and documentation to allow you to bring up and use your own RFID badge system. 

You will find the following folders:

1. Hardware: Contains the files for
1.1 creating the printed circuit board
1.2 CAD files for laser cutting the enclosure,
1.3 parts list

2. Software: Contains software for:
2.1 The Arduino C code to compile and download to the Particle.io Argon processor.
2.2 The Particle.io webhooks that allow the Argon to interact with internet based resources.
2.3 The MySQL database code and PHP web site that interface it to the internet.
2.4 The two Android administrator applications, written in the MIT App Inventor 2 environment.

3. Documents: A robust set of documentation for both assembly and operation of the RFID system.

4. Test And Development: Several programs that can be used to experiment with parts of the overall system. In particular, there are several programs we used to exercise the PN532 RFID system and software to help us understand how it works. We include them in case they are useful to you.

We hope this project is useful to you. We do not, of course, offer support in any way. However, drop us an email if you have questions and we might be able to advise you.
